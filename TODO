* Add on-the-fly conversion of RGB (X*Y*3 data cube) FITS images to G-only
(X*Y*1) images, equivalent to this example:
util/fitscopy r_ncas20201124_stacked.fit[*,*,2:2] r_ncas20201124_stacked_g2.fit

* Add support for "bias + scaled dark" CCD image calibration strategy

* A NOVAS-based routine that would compute geocentric J2000 positions of major planets.
(This is for quickly identifying bright transient candidates, so no need for high positional accuracy.)

* Automatically reject overexposed images in mk

* On fresh install the VSX catalog update is slow and silent.
Need to inform the user about what is going on!

* Specify image center for plate solver.

* Write warning in sextract_single_image that with the default settings 
a measurement will be dropped.

* Make sure to go to another period search server if the first one didn't work.

* Do a range check for all STAR*[Pos*[i]]

* Transfer to double-precision star positions

* First try to plate-solve with guessed coordinates and retry without them if failed...

* Support long filenames in ./lc display.

* Print amplitude in ./lc display.

* Do not try to guess gain if 'photocurve' is used for magnitude calibration???
Unless it is explicitly requested by user.

* inxi may not work (because of lspci for example) - deal with it

* Print error message when requested to convert from TT back to UTC.

* Single-image cosmic ray/hot pixel filter?

* Image arithmetics with floating point images

* util/ccd/mk - do robust sigma-clipping before MEDIAN-combining images???

* Ignore JD keyword if there is a comment "/Julian Date at start of exposure"

* Test on linux Mint

* Test CFITSIO after building

* Correct for differential extinction/flat-fielding problems while performing
absolute magnitude calibration using APASS.

* Make sure the narrow-field CCD test images can be plate-solved automatically

* Need support for sub-second timing in DATE-OBS. So far we are rounding to
1 sec due to the definition of struct tm (int tm_sec)
https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Broken_002ddown-Time.html

* Print "unknown key" message in lc and find_candidates

* Even more clear interpretation of the command line

* ZScale image scaling in pgfv???
