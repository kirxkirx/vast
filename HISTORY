vast-1.0rc85:
	* 'util/get_image_date' can be used to convert JD to calendar date/time:
	util/get_image_date 2456909.72911
	it can also be used to convert calendar date/time to JD:
	util/get_image_date 2014-09-09T05:29:55
	* The new script 'util/fov_of_wcs_calibrated_image.sh' will print the field of view,
	image scale and the image center position of a WCS-calibrated FITS image.
	* The new tool 'util/fits2png' will produce a PNG finder chart with no labels from 
	the input FITS image. Use 'util/make_finding_chart' to produce a finder chart with labels.
	In all cases the output image will be written to 'pgplot.png' file in the current directory.
	* Lightcurve files (out*.dat) listed as automatically selected candidate variables in vast_autocandidates.log
	as well as the ones listed by user as previously known variables in vast_list_of_previously_known_variables.log
	are now higlighted by the FITS viewer './sextract_single_image'
07 Mar 2019: vast-1.0rc84:
	* VaST is now on Github ( https://github.com/kirxkirx/vast ), pull requests are welcome!
	* The new script 'util/get_gaia_lc.sh' gets Gaia G, BP and RP lightcurves for a Gaia DR2 ID that 
	should be specified as a command line argument. You may get Gaia ID of a source at a given sky
	position by running 'util/search_databases_with_vizquery.sh' The lightcurves are saved in the folder 
	'gaia_lightcurves/' within the VaST main directory.
	* 'util/colstat' will take a column of numbers from a standard input and compute mean, median, sigma
	and other values describing the column. For example, to compute statistics on the scatter of magnitude
	measurements among all stars that passed the selection, one may extract the second column from 
	'vast_lightcurve_statistics.log' using 'cat' and 'awk' and send it to 'util/colstat' like this:
	cat vast_lightcurve_statistics.log | awk '{print $2}' | util/colstat
	* The script 'util/search_databases_with_vizquery.sh' is trying to guess the star's spectral type 
	from its 2MASS colors. The color-spectral type relation is updated to correspond to
	"A Modern Mean Dwarf Stellar Color and Effective Temperature Sequence" table by Eric Mamajek
	http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~emamajek/EEM_dwarf_UBVIJHK_colors_Teff.txt
	instead of the older reference http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1988PASP..100.1134B
	* Upgraded the internal copy of SExtractor to version 2.25.0 while keeping 2.19.5 as a the
	automatic fall-back option. The new SExtractor cannot be compiled on very old systems and
	it requires autoconf that is missing on BSD systems and (by default) in Ubuntu.
	If a system-wide installation of SExtractor is found (by simply testing for the presence of 
	'sex' executable in $PATH), the internal copy of SExtractor is not compiled at all to speed-up
	compilation.
	* Added integration with wcs-addpv.py script ( https://github.com/evertrol/sippv ) as the second line 
	of defense against the "TPV vs. SIP" problem: astrometry.net describes image distortions using 
	the SIP convention while SExtractor/SWarp and other Astromatic tools expect the TPV convention.
	The script requires python+numpy+scipy+astropy to run. If you run astrometry.net code locally,
	the required python tools are already installed in your system. The old trick with VaST using 'xy2sky' 
	from WCSTools to re-compute celestial coordinates in SExtractor catalogs still works, of course. 
	Having the TPV distortions inserted in the images plate-solved with VaST is especially useful 
	if you want to stack images with SWarp.
01 Oct 2018: vast-1.0rc83:
	* A careful review and refactoring of almost the entire VaST C-code tree was performed by Vladimir Bazilevich.
	* The variable identification script 'util/search_databases_with_vizquery.sh' will now try to identify 
	the input object with Gaia DR2 in addition to USNO-B1.0 and display its Gaia DR2 variability status
	(VARIABLE/CONSTANT/NOT_AVAILABLE) and if it's listed in Gaia DR2 Cepheid, RR Lyrae, LPV or Short-timescale 
	sources catalogs (see http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=I/345&-to=2 ).
	You may test the new output by running:
	 util/search_databases_with_vizquery.sh 22:02:43.29139 +42:16:39.9803
	* The variable identification script will search the ASASSN-V catalog downloading its local copy (currently 71M) at first use.
	* VaST will now automatically update the local copies of ASASSN-V and VSX catalogs, as well as the asteroid 
	database astorb.dat if they are more than one month old. The relevant code is in lib/update_offline_catalogs.sh
	You may run this script as 'lib/update_offline_catalogs.sh all' to download/update all catalogs.
	Note that the variable star catalogs are checked by the script util/search_databases_with_vizquery.sh in the following order:
	 1. VSX (offline copy) -- if available
	 2. ASASSN-V (offline copy)
	 3. GCVS (online)
	 4. VSX (online)
	 5. other catalogs in selected sky areas.
	The catalog search is performed until the first match is found. The (unintended) consequence of this is that 
	the displayed variable star name may depend on the available catalogs. For example if the local copy of VSX 
	is available, the search 'util/search_databases_with_vizquery.sh 34.8366337 -2.9776377' will result in
	"omi Cet" while if there is no local copy of VSX, the variable will first be found in the ASASSN-V 
	catalog and its name will be displayed as "ASASSN-V J021920.94-025841.2".
	* VaST will now drop one of the top-ten brightest stars from the instrumental (image-to-image) magnitude calibration.
	The excluded star is the one that changes the instrumental magnitude/reference magnitude fit the most.
	This helps to handle the situation when the variable is one of the few brightest stars on frames. 
	If the variability amplitude is sufficiently small to bypass the old outlier rejection algorithm, 
	such variable could influence the magnitude calibration (due to its high weight as a bright star) 
	and introduce artificial variability in other stars.
	Thanks to Vladimir Bazilevich for providing data that highlighted this problem!
	* Updated the dark frame subtraction ('util/ccd/ms') and flat-field division ('util/ccd/md') routines 
	to better handle images with overscan. Numerous bug fixes in these routines.
	* The PSF-quality filter (active in the PSF photometry mode) is disabled for the brightest stars on
	frame (along with the A_IMAGE and FWHM_IMAGE vs. mag filters). The relevant code is in src/filter_MagSize.c
	* VaST was not recognizing the long version of the '--aperture' command line option. This has been fixed.
	* Updated the internal copy of CFITSIO to version 3.440. The HTTPS support is disabled in the library
	to avoid the dependence on libcurl - no web access is performed through the CFITSIO functions in VaST.
16 Apr 2018: vast-1.0rc82:
	* Fixed the bug that caused VaST to segfault in some circumstances.
	* Fixed the bug in the lightcurve viewer './lc' that was causing a crash when the input
	lightcurve file was outside the VaST working directory.
	* Fixed the broken counter of stars rejected as having a bad PSF-fit in the PSF photometry mode.
	The counter was stuck displaying the value for the reference image, not the current image.
	* Fixed the bug that caused the UCAC plate solver to work incorrectly on BSD systems.
	* Instead of relying on UCAC4 for both astrometry and photometry, the plate solver now
	relies on UCAC5 for astrometry and APASS (now accessed separately form the astrometric catalog) 
	for photometry. If the field is not covered by APASS, the solver tries to use Pan-STARRS1
	as the fall-back option. In this case, Pan-STARRS1 magnitudes are converted to 
	APASS bands following Tonry et al. (2012, ApJ, 750, 99) http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...750...99T
	The new solver name is 'util/solve_plate_with_UCAC5', the 'util/solve_plate_with_UCAC4' is
	now a symbolic link to the new plate solver kept for backward compatibility with old scripts.
	* Normally, VaST will use for the instrumental magnitude (image-to-image) calibration only 
	the stars that were marked by SExtractor as non-blended. This causes problems if the majority 
	of stars on an image are marked as blended. To handle this, VaST will now accept for magnitude
	scale calibration blended stars if less than 50% of stars matched between the current and reference 
	images are marked as non-blended on both images.
	* The new command line option '--excluderefimage' will exclude the reference image from 
	all the output lightcurves. This is useful if you use a deep stacked image as the reference for a series of 
	individual-exposure images. With some additional scripting, this may also be used to incrementally add
	new observations as new images arrive, avoiding the need to reprocess all the available images of the field.
	Even if excluded, the reference image is still used as the photometric reference for the instrumental 
	(image-to-image) magnitude scale.
	* The FITS image viewer './pgfv' now displays celestial coordinates of pixels if the image 
	has the WCS information in its header. The pixel to celestial coordinates transformation is performed 
	using 'xy2sky' from WCSTools.
	* Changed the lightcurve clipping algorithm used to compute the clipped standard deviation (the default 
	variability statistic displayed by './find_candidates') to exactly match the description in 
	Appendix A of Pashchenko et al. (2018, MNRAS, 475, 2326) http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.475.2326P 
	* Revised the flag/weight image construction algorithm.
	* VaST is trying to identify candidate variables by applying magnitude-dependent cuts in 
	multiple variability indices. Some details of this process may be found in the new log file
	vast_autocandidates_details.log which lists for each star the variability tests that it passed (if any)
	as well as conditions (prefixed with '-') that will cause the star not to be flagged
	as variable even if it passed one of the variability tests. Currently these conditions include 
	the star being one of the few brightest or faintest stars on the frame or having a small reduced chi^2 
	value (large errors compared to the variability amplitude). The code relevant to the variability detection
	tests may be found in src/index_vs_mag.c and the variability detection thresholds for each test are set
	in src/vast_limits.h
	* The routine 'util/get_image_date' can now be used not only to get the observing time information from a 
	FITS image header, but also to convert the calendar date to JD on the command line using the following syntax:
	util/get_image_date '2014-09-09T05:29:55'
	* Disabled OpenMP on systems with less than 1GB of physical memory as it was found to
	cause problems in low-memory conditions.
	* Updated the internal copy of cdsclient to version 3.84.
	* Updated the internal copy of GSL to version 2.4.
28 Dec 2017: vast-1.0rc81:
	* Implemented a new way of filtering-out blended sources. For each source VaST counts how
	many times it was detected and how many times it did not pass the magnitude-size filter.
	Sources that pass the filter less than a specified fraction of times are rejected.
	The minimum fraction of detections that should pass the magnitude-size filter is set
	by MIN_FRACTION_OF_GOOD_MEASUREMENTS in src/vast_limits.h (the default is 0.7)
	This helps to reject close pairs of stars that can be separated only on images
	with the best seeing, but still result in corrupted photometry.
	* Introduced a more efficient way of computing magnitude-dependent thresholds for variability indices.
	This should considerably speed-up computations for datasets containing >1000 sources.
	* For images that contain large blank areas with zero counts (like mosaics or images resampled to the 
	north-up/east-left orientation) VaST will now construct and apply weight images.
	The weight images are needed for SExtractor to exclude the blank areas from background estimation.
	Incorrect background estimation may affect photometry of sources that are near the blank areas.
	The downside is that you cannot use WEIGHT_TYPE BACKGROUND together with the VaST-generated weight images.
	The previous versions of VaST were producing only flag images that were useful to flag false source
	detections near the blank image areas, but did not affect the background estimation for sources that
	do not get flagged.
 	* Added a command line option that disables bad image identification: '-6' or '--notremovebadimages'.
	* Added routines to handle time records in images from the Aristarchos telescope.
	* Because of the way broken-down time to JD conversion is implemented, VaST still cannot 
	handle sub-second timing. Now if the exposure start time is specified to an accuracy of 
	better than one second in the FITS header, VaST will properly round it to the nearest second
	instead of truncating at the decimal point (taking the floor of the floating point number of seconds).
	* The new utility 'util/fix_image_date' may update FITS image header in order to specify
	the observing time in the "standard" format described by the two keywords:
	DATE-OBS (exposure start time in UTC) and EXPTIME (exposure duration in seconds).
	Note that this will work only if the exposure time is already written in the FITS header
	(or in the vast_list_of_input_images_with_time_corrections.txt file) in a format understandable
	to VaST. This utility may be useful to make the observing time information readable
	to software other than VaST.
	* The middle of exposure may now be specified with JDMID keyword in the image header.
	The old way of specifying the middle of exposure with JD keyword works too.
	* The manual magnitude calibration display now doesn't allow one to set magnitudes of saturated stars
	(identified by the SExtractor flag >=4).
	* VaST will not start if it fails to recognize a command line option.
	This should prevent typos in long option names from going unnoticed.
	* Access to online plate-solving and period search services is now working from inside
	a firewall that blocks ping. Originally, ping was (naively) used by VaST to test server availability. 
	Now if ping fails the relevant scripts will try to send HTTP GET requests to the servers and 
	conclude that VaST is running offline only if both ping and GET fail.
	* util/wcs_image_calibration.sh will not re-run SExtractor if a catalog of sources 
	corresponding to the given image was already created by VaST while processing the image series.
	This should speed-up the typical workflow:
	"process a series of images with VaST" -> "plate solve some or all of these images".
	* The external catalog matching routine 'util/solve_plate_with_UCAC4' iteratively 
	improves plate solution by computing and applying local astrometric corrections.
	Each iteration involves the slow step of network communication with VizieR.
	If you are sure that the astrometric solution is good enough after the first iteration,
	you may set MAX_NUMBER_OF_ITERATIONS_FOR_UCAC4_MATCH to 1 in src/vast_limits.h to speed-up processing.
06 Oct 2017: vast-1.0rc80:
	* Added a workaround for the PV/SIP WCS convention problem that does not allow
	SExtractor to take into account the distortion corrections determined by Astrometry.net
	see http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012SPIE.8451E..1MS for a detailed discussion. 
	The workaround is to use xy2sky routine from WCSTools to convert SExtractor-derived
	pixel coordinates to celestial coordinates rather than relying on SExtractor
	to do this conversion.
	* The magnitude measurements are now performed in multiple apertures for each image:
	  ref. ap. = median(A_IMAGE) * CONST the reference aperture (the same used by previous 
	version of VaST), here median(A_IMAGE) is the median semi-major axis lengths among all
	the sources detected at the current image, CONST = 6 (may be changed in src/vast_limits.h),
	  ap. 1 = AP01 * ref. ap., by default AP01=-0.1
	  ap. 2 = AP02 * ref. ap., by default AP02=0.1
          ap. 3 = AP03 * ref. ap., by default AP03=0.2
          ap. 4 = AP04 * ref. ap., by default AP04=0.3
	the values of AP* parameters may be change in src/vast_limits.h. The measurements in 
	multiple apertures are used to reject blended sources if '--magsizefilter' is enabled
	(see below) or to select for each object an aperture producing its lightcurve with 
	the smallest scatter. The second is an experimental option, it is disabled by default 
	and may be activated by specifying '--selectbestaperture' or '-3' option on the command line. 
	Please try and see if enabling this option actually improves the results with your data.
	* The magnitude-size filter now includes a battery of filters aimed at rejecting blended
	and extended sources. For each frame VaST rejects outliers on the instrumental magnitude
	vs parameter plots where the parameters are A_IMAGE, FWHM_IMAGE, mag(ref. ap.)-MAG_AUTO,
	mag(ref. ap.)-mag(ap. 1), mag(ref. ap.)-mag(ap. 2), mag(ref. ap.)-mag(ap. 3),
	mag(ref. ap.)-mag(ap. 4), A_IMAGE/B_IMAGE.
	The filtering is now enabled by default. You may disable it 
	with '--nomagsizefilter' or '-2' command line options. If image contains many artifacts such as
	cosmic rays or hot pixels (often found in CMOS chips) that outnumber stars at some magnitude range, 
	the filter may do more harm than good. If this is the case for your images, try disabling the filter 
	and set more conservative SExtractor source detection parameters in default.sex
	Details about VaST magnitude-size filtering for each image may be visualized in gnuplot using the log files
	image*.cat.magsizefilter_* (for A_IMAGE) and image*.cat.magparameter*filter_* for the remaining
	filtering parameters. See SExtractor manual for the detailed description of A_IMAGE, FWHM_IMAGE, MAG_AUTO.
	* The magnitude calibration script now scales the photometric errorbars, not only the magnitudes themselves.
	This makes a big difference with 'photocurve' calibration at the bright end.
	* Photometric measurements with errorbars larger than MAX_MAG_ERROR=1.086/MIN_SNR=0.362mag (for the default MIN_SNR=3)
	are now ignored at all processing stages. You may change the maximum allowed error in src/vast_limits.h
	* VaST now tries to rescale the errorbars determined by SExtractor using the relation
	  sigma_new=sqrt( (gamma*sigma_old)^2 + epsilon^2 )
	where the coefficients gamma and epsilon are determined using all non-variable stars in the current dataset.
	This relation is inspired by the OGLE rescaling of photometric errors in DIA as described by
	http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.468.2189Z
	http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009MNRAS.397.1228W
	VaST is not allowed to make the errors smaller than the ones reported by SExtractor, 
	so the parameters are forced to have the values gamma>=1.0 and epsilon^2>=0.0.
	Here epsilon may be interpreted as the systematic noise floor in the current dataset.
	The photometric errorbars rescaling is enabled by default. It may be disabled by running 
	'./vast --noerrorsrescale /path/to/images/*fit' or './vast -4 /path/to/images/*fit'
	The new line in vast_summary.log indicates if the errorbars rescaling was requested or not:
	Photometric errors rescaling: YES / NO
	The photometric errorbars rescaling is usually not needed in the PSF photometry mode,
	but should do no harm if applied.
	* VaST selects candidate variables (listed in 'vast_autocandidates.log' and highlighted in blue in './find_candidates')
	as objects that stand out in one or more variability index vs. magnitude plots. VaST also lists
	candidate non-variable stars in 'vast_list_of_likely_constant_stars.log' -- these are well-measured 
	stars that do not stand out in multiple variability indexes simultaneously. The process of selecting
	candidate variables and candidate constant stars may now be controlled via the parameters set in 'src/vast_limits.h'
	(they follow the 'Automated selection of candidate variables' comment). See http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.464..274S
	for a detailed discussion of variability indexes implemented in VaST.
	* ./find_candidates now deletes the list of previously-viewed lightcurves kept in vast_viewed_lightcurves.log
	if started with no command line arguments ('recompute everything' mode). In earlier versions this file
	was kept which caused unexpected behavior: every time the candidate viewer was run as
	'./find_candidates aa'
	(in the 're-display previously-computed variability statistics' mode) it was highlighting 
	all the previously-viewed objects, regardless of how many times variability statistics
	were recomputed with './find_candidates'
	* It is now possible to send a lightcurve to the online period search tool from 
	the lightcurve viewer ('./lc') by pressing 'L' key when the lightcurve viewer was 
	not started from the VaST directory. For example:
	 cd /path/to/my_lightcurve_archive
	 /home/path_to/vast-1.0rc80/lc my_lightcurve.txt
	* Implemented a more efficient procedure that should speed-up lightcurve writing 
	on all systems supporting OpenMP.
	* Fixed the bug that prevented VaST from saving magnitude calibration details
	under some circumstances. The symptom was that vast_magnitude_calibration_details_log 
	was an ASCII file instead of being a directory containing the calibration details.
	* VaST should now be able to understand observation start dates written in DATE-BEG
	FITS header keyword instead of the usual DATE-OBS (as recommended by the draft FITS Standard V4.0).
	* VaST may now open "slice of a data cube" i.e. an image with NAXIS = 3 and NAXIS3 = 1.
	Such slice number $CUBE_SLICE may be extracted from an actual 3D data cube named $INPUT_IMAGE_CUBE
	using 'fitscopy' example program from CFITSIO:
	fitscopy "$INPUT_IMAGE_CUBE[*,*,$CUBE_SLICE:$CUBE_SLICE]" \!"$OUTPUT_IMAGE_NAME"
	* VaST will now complain if it encounters a FITS image compressed by MaxIM DL.
	These images have to be uncompressed in MaxIM DL before they can be processed with VaST 
	(or any other software that is not MaxIM DL - I love proprietary data formats).
	* Changed axis labels in './find_candidates' to indicate that the displayed values of MAD and IQR
	are scaled to sigma (to ease comparison with the mag-sigma plot).
	* The new '--starmatchraius' command line option may be used to tweak the star matching radius -
	the maximum distance in pixels (after applying XY coordinates transformation) between the objects
	detected on two images for these objects to be assumed the same. You may need to tweak this parameter
	in case you experience problems with blending.
	* Fixed the numerical overflow issue in the flat-field correction routine 'util/ccd/md'
	that was causing centers of saturated stars to appear black.
	* Added support for the I band to the magnitude calibration script 'util/magnitude_calibration.sh',
	as with the R band, I magnitudes are computed from APASS r and i magnitudes of the field stars
	using the color transformations by Jester et al. 2005 AJ, 130, 873 http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005AJ....130..873J
	* A safe value for one of the memory-management parameters MAX_MEASUREMENTS_IN_RAM in src/vast_limits.h 
	is now set automatically at compile time based on the available amount of physical memory.
	* Minor bug fixes.
22 Jun 2017: vast-1.0rc79:
	* It is now possible to record values of any keywords from a FITS image header 
	alongside the brightness measurements derived from this image. The keyword name 
	and value are written in the lightcurve (out*.dat) files starting from column 8.
	The list of keywords to be recorded is specified in the ASCII file 
	vast_list_of_FITS_keywords_to_record_in_lightcurves.txt one keyword per line. 
	You may use 'util/listhead file.fits' to list the available keywords.
	The intended use of this new keyword-recording feature is to enable external-parameter 
	decorrelation of the brightness measurements (e.g. decorrelate the lightcurve with AIRMASS). 
	As a by-product, it is now possible to keep free-format comments in lightcurve files after 
	Column 7 that lists the image filename from which a given measurement was obtained.
	* If presented with a multi-extension FITS (like the one downloaded from the HLA) VaST
	will now extract sources only from the first image extension, assuming other image extensions 
	in the file are data quality images (ignored by VaST).
	* If REMOVE_FLAG_IMAGES_TO_SAVE_SPACE is defined in src/vast_limits.h at compile-time,
	VaST will not keep the flag images it produces to filter-out detections along the image edges
	(e.g. if overscan area is present on the image). This will save disk space.
	* Re-written the algorithm rejecting bad PSF fits in the PSF photometry mode ('-P' option).
	* A copy of NOVAS library updated to v3.1.
	* Updated the internal copy of CFITSIO library to v3.410.
	* Minor bug fixes.
29 Mar 2017: vast-1.0rc78:
	* If no image is specified for './sextract_single_image' on the command line - it will display the reference image.
	* VaST has a new experimental feature: it tries to suggest candidate variables.
	It now produces two star lists:
	 - vast_autocandidates.log - a list of candidate variables that stand out in mag-IQR or mag-1/eta plots.
	A cut on the reduced chi^2 value is also applied. The idea here is that photometric errors are usually 
	underestimated, but not overestimated, so if variability is small compared to the estimated errors than it 
	is likely not real.
	Keep in mind that the selected stars are just stars with high scatter or very smooth lightcurves, 
	VaST doesn't know much beyond that. All candidate variables should be inspected by eye(!!!).
	It is especially important to inspect images of the candidate variables as they may reveal measurement
	problems like blending or bad CCD pixels that artificially increase the lightcurve scatter.
	 - vast_list_of_likely_constant_stars.log - list of likely constant stars that do not stand out in
	mag-IQR, mag-1/eta and mag-weighted_sigma plots. The reduced chi^2 value is not considered here
	as the photometric errors may be highly underestimated (resulting in high reduced chi^2 values for constant stars).
	* A new experimental filter may be activated by running VaST with the option '-1' or '--magsizefilter':
	for each image it will try to filter-out extended or blended objects (that cannot be properly measured) 
	by removing outliers on the size-magnitude plot.
	* When constructing lightcurves VaST now always ignores detections with SExtractor flags >7 
	as positions of such sources cannot be accurately measured anyhow.
	* VaST can now handle images that have few (about 50 or so) stars.
	If these are CCD images, it is highly recommended to use a linear function for magnitude
	calibration instead of the default parabolic one. To use linear magnitude calibration run
	VaST with '-p' command line option:
	./vast -p ../sample_data/*.fit
	* After creating lightcurves, VaST is trying to identify bad images in the input series as the ones
	which have a large percentage of outlier measurements associated with them. If measurements obtained 
	from a given image are 3*sigma outliers in the lightcurves of at least 10% of objects detected on this image
	- probably something is wrong with this image and all measurements taken from it will be rejected.
	The first (reference) image never gets rejected.
	If the lightcurves are imported and not produced by VaST, you may run the bad-image-rejection
	procedure manually: lib/remove_bad_images 0.1
	where 0.1 is the maximum allowed fraction of 3*sigma outliers in an image.
	* Now it is possible to set a non-zero MAG_ZEROPOINT in default.sex if you want.
	But generally speaking, it is not easy to know the exact value of MAG_ZEROPOINT
        for a reference image: you first need to calibrate it somehow and then run
        VaST with the fixed aperture size (like '-a5.0' for a fixed 5 pixel
        diameter aperture) because if you let VaST to choose an aperture on its own
        - the aperture may be inappropriate for the specified MAG_ZEROPOINT value.
	The standard practice is still to let VaST construct lightcurves in instrumental magnitudes 
	(with MAG_ZEROPOINT 0.0) and then calibrate the magnitude scale using the script
	util/magnitude_calibration.sh
	* Improved thread creation logic for parallel image processing in SExtractor to avoid gaps when
	multiple processing cores are underutilized. This should lead to a slight increase in processing speed.
	* It is now possible to manually control the number of threads created by VaST by setting 
	the environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS before running VaST. 
	Here is a BASH example of how to set the variable:
	export OMP_NUM_THREADS=5
	(will set the number of threads to 5). This variable is respected even by parts of 
	the code that do not rely on OpenMP and use the simple fork() to create multiple threads.
	You may also set N_FORK in src/vast_limits.h but this will affect only parts of the code
	parallelized with fork() (notably, parallel processing of images with SExtractor) but 
	will not affect parts of the code parallelized with OpenMP. In that case, OpenMP will 
	decide on the optimal number of threads for running the OpenMP-parallelized code at runtime 
	depending on current system load.
	* Removed the default filter lib/remove_points_with_large_errors that was sigma-clipping 
	the lightcurves based on estimated photometric errors. This filter may be slow and appears to 
	be not very effective. You may run lib/remove_points_with_large_errors manually on your
	lightcurves and see if it helps or not. 
	* Minor bug fixes.
24 Feb 2017: vast-1.0rc77:
	* Fixed the matching algorithm crash occurring if more sources are detected on the second image
	than on the first one (have no idea how this bug was hiding itself for all the previous years).
	* Fixed the bug in util/solve_plate_with_UCAC4 that resulted in sub-optimal choice of 
	stars for computing local astrometric correction.
	* It is now possible to plot a lightcurve of an object, selecting it on the reference image.
	After processing a set of images in the usual way (like './vast ../dir_with_images/*') run 
	the new script
	./select_star_on_reference_image
	It will display the reference image with all the detected source marked. You may click on 
	a source to see its lightcurve. Note that some sources detected on the reference image that 
	did not pass selection criteria on the number of detections and extraction flags may not 
	have a lightcurve file written for them (and hence it will not be possible to display their 
	lightcurves).
	* Updated the script util/search_databases_with_vizquery.sh to make it more suitable for
	stand-alone use. Suppose you are interested which star is located at the position
	18:38:06.48 +39:40:06.0 J2000 and what is its spectral type (guessed from 2MASS colors), just run:
	util/search_databases_with_vizquery.sh 18:38:06.48 +39:40:05.9
	* The lightcurve formatting tool util/cute_lc now sorts the output lightcurve in JD.
	* Updated the internal copy of SExtractor to v2.19.5. Note that the internal copy
	of SExtractor is configured with '--disable-model-fitting' option in order to avoid 
	dependency on the ATLAS library. Therefore, it cannot perform PSF-fitting photometry.
	If you need PSF-fitting photometry - install SExtractor system-wide.
	* The internal copy of SExtractor is now compiled with the optimization flag '-march=native'
	if appropriate.
	* Updated the internal copy of CFITSIO library to v3.390.
	* Added a copy of FITSVERIFY https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/ftools/fitsverify/
	to test that input images are actually valid FITS files.
	* The CFITSIO example program that prints a FITS header is now available as util/listhead
	* The CFITSIO example program for editing keys in a FITS header is now available as util/modhead
	* VaST now creates image*.cat.info files with (more-or-less) detailed information about how 
	each input image was processed.
	* VaST now creates vast_lightcurve_statistics_format.log file with a plain-text description
	of the format of vast_lightcurve_statistics.log - the file that contains all the variability 
	indices computed for each star in the field.
	* Minor bug fixes and improvements.
13 Sep 2016: vast-1.0rc76:
	* Added the command-line period search tool implementing Lafler & Kinman (1965, ApJS, 11, 216)
	http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1965ApJS...11..216L and Deeming (1975, Ap&SS, 36, 137)
	http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1975Ap%26SS..36..137D methods.
	The code is shared with the online period search tool accessible at
	http://scan.sai.msu.ru/lk/ or through the VaST lightcurve inspection tool. 
	The online tool is still recommended for interactive period search. 
	The code distributed with VaST is useful to estimate the upper limit on 
	the significance of a period by performing lightcurve shuffling as described by, for example,
	Koen & Eyer (2002, MNRAS, 331, 45) http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002MNRAS.331...45K
	Note that the lightcurve shuffling technique gives only an upper limit on 
	the period detection significance as it ignores all systematic instrumental 
	variations that might be present in the lightcurve (the shuffling is based on 
	the assumption that all magnitude measurements are independent).
	Example usage of the command-line period search tool:
	lib/deeming_compute_periodogram lib/test/hads_p0.060.dat 1.0 0.05 0.1
	this will search the lightcurve lib/test/hads_p0.060.dat for periodicities using
	the Deeming method in the range of trial periods from 1.0d to 0.05d with
	the frequency step corresponding to the maximum phase shift of 0.1 between 
	the first and the last points of the lightcurve. The program will print
	16.661975 111.832792 DFT 
	where 16.661975 is the frequency (cycles per day) of the highest DFT peak 111.832792
	To estimate the significance of this peak one may shuffle the lightcurve 100 times:
	lib/deeming_compute_periodogram lib/test/hads_p0.060.dat 1.0 0.05 0.1 100
	(takes long time to compute as this is a short period searched in a long lightcurve):
	16.661975 111.832792  0.000000 +/- 0.000000 DFT
	here 0.000000 +/- 0.000000 is the reported p-value of the period and it's error
	(lower p-value corresponds to a more-significant period detection). In this example
	none of the 100 shuffled lightcurves gives a peak as significant as the one found
	in the real lightcurve, so the reported p-value = 0.0. Typically, 1000 to 10000
	shuffling iterations are needed for a reliable estimation of p-value.
	The same period search and lightcurve shuffling, but using the Lafler & Kinman method:
	lib/lk_compute_periodogram lib/test/hads_p0.060.dat 1.0 0.05 0.1 100
	will print
	16.661975 1.631221  0.000000 +/- 0.000000 LK
	* The interactive online period search script ( ./pokaz_laflerkinman.sh 
	that can be called from the lightcurve inspection window by pressing 'L') 
	is now not tied to a single period-search server. The script randomly 
	chooses one of a few servers after checking their availability.
	* Fixed the GCVS search with util/search_databases_with_curl.sh
	(the output format of the search form has changed which broke down
	the search script).
	* The Makefile is renamed to GNUmakefile and the new makefile is
	intended only to start gmake. This, together with some minor changes
	in the compilation scripts, should save a user from the necessity to
	think if 'make' or 'gmake' command should be used to compile VaST on
	a particular operating system: now it's always 'make' and the
	scripts will figure out on their own if and how to run GNU Make.
	However, GNU Make needs to be installed in the system (and
	accessible as either 'make' or 'gmake') as the current VaST makefiles 
	are incompatible with other make flavors.
	* Updated tai-utc.dat file includes the leap second to be inserted 
	on 2016 December 31st at 23:59:60 UTC. (This is needed for accurate 
	UTC->TT conversion after that date.)
21 Feb 2016: version vast-1.0rc75:
	* Minor modifications to speed-up the star matching algorithm.
	* When manually opening a lightcurve file with './lc' it is now
	possible to refer to the star only by its number without specifying
	the full filename, i.e. './lc 12184' instead of './lc out12184.dat'.
	The old way with the full file name still works, of course.
	* VaST can now properly handle the situation when DATE-OBS keyword
	is present in the FITS image header, but does not specify the
	observing time and a separate TIME-OBS keyword is not present.
	In this case, VaST will try to get the observing date from JD keyword.
	* Rewritten the SysRem algorithm implementation (Tamuz, Mazeh & Zucker, 2005, MNRAS, 356, 1466).
	The new version should work faster and be less aggressive in
	rejecting uncorrectable stars. The new implementation may be run as util/sysrem2
	I'm keeping the old util/sysrem too for now.
	* Changed the way maximum trial period is set for the period search
	in pokaz_laflerkinman.sh Now pmax=int(jd_range/3.0-0.5)
	* Fixed the experimental script that retrieves Catalina sky survey
	data for a specified (small) sky area: util/catalina_search_area_TEST.sh
	* Added the interquartile range (IQR https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range ) 
	as another measure of lightcurve scatter. In practice it turns out
	to be very similar to the median absolute deviation (MAD https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_absolute_deviation )
	that was added earlier.
	* Added a small tool that splits multi-extension FITS files into 
	single-extension FITS images that can be processed with VaST:
	util/split_multiextension_fits /path/to/my_multiextension.fits
	* Changed PSF extraction settings in default.psfex
	The new settings are more appropriate for a wide-field instrument.
	The old settings may be found in default.psfex.small_FoV
	It may be a good idea to apply a few iterations of SysRem 
	( util/sysrem2 ) to remove residual systematic effects arising
	from imperfect PSF reconstruction that may degrade photometric
	accuracy for bright stars.
	* Changes in util/solve_plate_with_UCAC4 to make it work faster.
	The results of its work are not exactly the same as in the previous
	version, but should be still acceptable.
	* Circumvent the mysterious gcc bug that refused to compile VaST with
	the parameter "-march=native" set on some combination of gcc version
	and CPU model. The new test is trying to compile the problematic
	C-source file and does not set "-march=native" if this test compilation fails.
	* Minor improvements in the Makefile to speed-up compilation. The
	changes also allowed to fix problem with compilation on some Ubuntu
	systems. Unfortunately, the changes rely on GNU make syntax, so if
	you are on non-Linux system, it is now necessary to compile VaST
	with 'gmake' instead of just 'make'.
	* Fixed the VaST testing script ( util/examples/test_vast.sh ) that
	reported a failed test after the variable "NSV 11188" got its GCVS
	name "V1451 Her" that was not previously recognized by the script.
	* Increased timeout for plate-solving (both remote and using a local
	copy of Astrometry.net software).
24 Oct 2015: version vast-1.0rc74
	* VaST is now not trying to create a flag image in cases where there 
	are many zero-value pixels scattered across the image rather than being
	grouped in specific areas (like along a frame edge). This makes it
	possible again to process background-subtracted images with VaST.
	* Fixed the bug with incorrect observing time being set from "EXPSTART" keyword.
	No problem appeared if other keywords ("DATE-OBS", "JD") were
	present in an image header.
	* By default, VaST now accepts stars having SExtractor flag set to 1:
	"The object has neighbors, bright and close enough to significantly
	bias the photometry, or bad pixels (more than 10% of the integrated area
	affected)." It appears that in practice many stars that can be measured 
	well get this flag. As always, you may manually specify the maximum
	acceptable SExtractor flag with '-x' option on the command line:
	# Accept blended stars
	./vast -x3 /path/to/my/images*.fit
	# Accept everything including saturated stars
	./vast -x99 /path/to/my/images*.fit
	* VaST now compiles with link time optimization (LTO) enabled by default on Linux systems. 
	If this doesn't work for you - remove `lib/set_lto.sh`
	from OPTFLAGS in Makefile and re--compile with 'make'.
	* Further improvements to the automatic testing script util/examples/test_vast.sh
	Beware, the script will download ~2Gb of test data  and will need an hour to run!
	If you have fast internet connection, you are welcome to run this
	test script. Please write me if the test script reports any problems.
	* Added warning messages discouraging a user from running VaST on a small
	number of images (and then be disappointed by the result).
	Currently, the two 'proper' ways to run VaST are:
	1) Run VaST on a long (50-100-1000) series of images and inspect
	lightcurves that show a large scatter.
	2) Run VaST in the 'transient detection' mode on *four* (4) images:
	two reference and two second-epoch images. Then create an HTML
	search report by running
	util/transients/search_for_transients_single_field.sh
	VaST will run on a different number of images 2, 3, 5 (now printing
	the warning message), but the results are unpredictable.
	* Added Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) as one of the displayed variability
	indexes, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_absolute_deviation
	* Changed the "Modified sigma" index to the simple "Weighted sigma"
	* Stetson's J and L variability indexes computed using time-based
	weighting are now displayed. For a detailed discussion of these indexes see
	http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996PASP..108..851S
	and
	http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012AJ....143..140F
	* S_B variability detection statistic is now displayed, see
	http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013A&A...556A..20F
	for a detailed discussion.
	* The variability index plots are now displayed in the following order: 
	1) Standard deviation
	2) Weighted standard deviation
	3) Median Absolute deviation (MAD)
	4) Robust median statistic (RoMS)
	5) Stetson's J with time-based weighting of pairs
	6) Stetson's L with time-based weighting of pairs
	7) S_B variability detection statistic
	The first four indexes characterize the lightcurve scatter, Stetson's
	indexes (5 and 6) characterize the degree of correlation between
	consecutive measurements, S_B statistic (7) combines information
	about the correlation and the overall scatter. As before, you may 
	switch between these plots by pressing 'M' or 'N' on the keyboard 
	while in the variability search window (./find_candidates).
	* util/load.sh the script that loads work previously saved with
	util/save.sh now checks if SExtractor configuration files that 
	are to be loaded are the same as the ones currently present in VaST
	directory. If the files are identical, the script doesn't bother
	user with the silly question "Do you want to rewrite a configuration
	file?". The program md5sum should be installed in your system for 
	this functionality to work.
	* The VaST settings header file src/limits.h is renamed to src/vast_limits.h
	to avoid confusion with the standard C library header file also called limits.h
	* Edited src/gsl/Makefile.in so GSL can compile without makeinfo (texinfo)
	installed in the system.
	* Added timeout of 300 seconds to all network communications so the
	program doesn't hang indefinitely if the connection fails at a critical moment.
	* Changed the way all VaST subroutines read lightcurve files - now they
	use a dedicated function rather than simple 'scanf()'. This will
	eventually allow VaST to natively handle lightcurve files in formats
	other than the strict VaST format of "JD mag err X Y ap imagefilename".
	The downside of this change is that lightcurve reading is noticeably
	slower than it used to be.
	The support of multiple lightcurve formats is still it the experimental stage though. 
	For now, in order to import ASCII lightcurve files in the format "JD mag err" into VaST
	use the script util/convert/three_column_ascii2vast.sh which will
	convert them into the strict VaST format.
23 Jun 2015: version vast-1.0rc73
	* Fixed the bug that caused VaST to fail if it tries to guess 
	a saturation limit of an image that does not contain BUNIT key in
	its header (sadly, the majority of ground-based images do not 
	have this keyword).
	* Saturated pixels with values = 65535 are not flagged-out in the
	flag image in order not to remove the saturated objects from the
	list of detections. The brightest objects, even saturated ones, 
	are useful for image matching and performing a blind plate solution
	with the Astrometry.net code.
	* An additional aperture photometry run is performed for each image
	processed in the PSF-fitting mode. The goal is, again, to have the
	list of detections that includes the brightest stars. Under the
	normal circumstances, saturated stars are omitted by VaST from the 
	list of detections when working in the PSF-photometry mode.
	The brightest stars are needed to perform blind plate solution with
	the Astrometry.net code.
	* VaST is not attempting to create a flag image for input images
	that contain many negative values as, in this case, zero-value pixels
	are likely not the bad ones and should not be flagged.
	* Restored the partly-broken transient detection mode. See the
	instructions at http://scan.sai.msu.ru/vast/#transientsearch
	if you want to try it. The links to external resources in the HTML
	transient search report located in transient_report/index.html 
	(including MPChecker as well as CSS and NMW archives) are working again.
	* It is now possible to exit the catalog magnitude calibration plot
	by pressing 'x' on a keyboard. Before the program was expecting only
	the capital 'X' or right mouse click to exit.
	* Added timeout and retry attempts to util/solve_plate_with_UCAC4
	subroutine in order to be able to recover from network connection
	failures during communication with VizieR.
	* Further improvements to the automatic testing script util/examples/test_vast.sh
	Beware, the script will download ~1.5Gb of test data!
	If you have fast internet connection, you are welcome to run this
	test script. Please write me if the test script reports any problems.
	* Updates and broken-link fixes on the VaST web page: http://scan.sai.msu.ru/vast/
	* The outdated README file is replaces by an HTML page in doc/ directory.
10 Jun 2015: version vast-1.0rc72 
	* Fixed the PSF photometry mode that was not working for images that
	do not require creation of an external flag image.
	* VaST is now trying to explicitly set GAIN value if it is found in
	the FITS header ("GAIN" keyword). You may also set the GAIN value
	manually in default.sex file - VaST will not try to override it if
	if it finds that the default gain value in default.sex is changed.
	VaST will also try to recognize "count" and "countrate" images where 
	the image units are "electrons" and "electrons/s" instead of ADUs
	(electrons/gain) and set an appropriate gain value ("1" or equal to
	exposure time in seconds, respectively). The correct gain value is 
	needed to estimate Poisson noise contribution to photometric
	measurement errors. See equation (61) in Section 10.4 of SExtractor
	documentation ( https://www.astromatic.net/pubsvn/software/sextractor/trunk/doc/sextractor.pdf ).
	Note that SExtractor itself will try to override both GAIN and
	SATUR_LEVEL values set in default.sex using FITS header keys
	specified in default.sex as GAIN_KEY and SATUR_KEY.
	Please set an appropriate gain value in default.sex if this
	information is not available from FITS image header.
	* The plotting programs ./find_candidates, ./lc, ./pgfv
	now ignore clicks outside the plotting area, so now one can easily
	switch between multiple windows by left-clicking green area outside
	the plot in each window.
	* The lightcurve viewer ./lc now marks the latest lightcurve point 
	that was inspected by user.
	* The internal copy of CFITSIO library is updated to v3.370.
	* Introduced VaST testing script util/examples/test_vast.sh 
	Beware, the script will download ~1.5Gb of test data!
	If you have fast internet connection, you are welcome to run this
	test script. Please write me if the test script reports any problems.
27 May 2015: версия vast-1.0rc71 Переименован ds9-файл с регионами из vast_list_of_all_stars.ds9 в vast_list_of_all_stars.ds9.reg чтобы
	* ds9 не пытался его прочитать каждый раз при старте. Правильное использование файла: 
	ds9 /path/to/reference/image.fits -region vast_list_of_all_stars.ds9.reg
	* ./pgfv поддерживает 32 битные изображения в шапке которых не указан ключ BZERO.
	* ./pgfv поддерживает изображения с малым диапазоном значений: от 0.0 до 1.0.
	* Tested on FreeBSD 10.1.
	./pgfv теперь может работать с файлами в именах которых есть пробел.
	* The internal image viewer ./pgfv, if started from the lightcurve                                                                     
	inspection tool ./lc, will automatically zoom-in on the star of interest.                                                              
	You may see the full image by pressing 'D' or 'Z'+'Z' to zoom-out.
	* Restored the PSF photometry option (requires PSFEx and a recent SExtractor version). Example usage:
	./vast -P ../sample_data/f_72-0*
	* Instead of just displaying the familiar mag-sigma plot, ./find_candidates
	can now also plot the following variability indexes as a function of magnitude:
		+ Weighted sigma divided by the number of points in the
	lightcurve. The idea is to artificially hide the lightcurves
	having large sigma but only a small number of measurements. The
	weighting scheme follows Stetson (1996) attempting to downweight
	outlier points in a lightcurve.
		+ Stetson's L variability index as defined in the 1996 paper, see http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996PASP..108..851S
		+ Robust Median Statistic (RoMS) as defined by Enoch, Brown & Burgasser (2003), see http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003AJ....126.1006E
		+ The simple "peak-to-peak" variability index suggested by Aller, Aller & Hughes (1992), see http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992ApJ...399...16A
	The index is defined as v = ( ( M_max - error(M_max) ) - ( M_min + error(M_min) ) )/ ( ( M_max - error(M_max) ) + ( M_min + error(M_min) ) )
	so it can be negative if the observed lightcurve scatter is lower than estimated errors.
	Use 'M' and 'N' keys to switch between the plots.
	For all the plots, a higher value generally indicates that an object is more likely to be variable.
	* The default SExtractor parameter file default.param is changed to use "XWIN_IMAGE, YWIN_IMAGE"
	star positions instead of "X_IMAGE, Y_IMAGE". It should produce improved astrometric accuracy
	at the cost of slightly longer computing time. See Section 10.2 of the "official" SExtractor documentation
	( https://www.astromatic.net/pubsvn/software/sextractor/trunk/doc/sextractor.pdf ) for details.
	* VaST is now able to handle HST Level 1 (exposure) images from the Hubble Legacy Archive (hla.stsci.edu),
	specifically it can set the correct observing date by reading EXPSTART key containing MJD of the exposure start.
	* VaST is able to guess the saturation limit for each image as 
	guessed_saturation_limit=maxval-SATURATION_LIMIT_INDENT*maxval;
	where maxval is the brightest image pixel and SATURATION_LIMIT_INDENT is set in src/limits.h, 
	by default SATURATION_LIMIT_INDENT=0.1. This behaviour may be turned on by running ./vast with -g option or
	off by using -G option. If none of the two options is specified explicitly, VaST will make a wild guess
	if it should use SATUR_LEVEL specified in default.sex or if it should try to guess it for each image individually.
	* VaST will check how many pixels having the value of exactly zero are in
	the input image and if there are more than FRACTION_OF_ZERO_PIXEL_TO_USE_FLAG_IMG*total_number_of_pixels
	the program will automatically produce a flag image for SExtractor to
	filter-out stars overlapping with these bad pixels. The value of
	FRACTION_OF_ZERO_PIXEL_TO_USE_FLAG_IMG can be changed in src/limits.h.
	Make sure to run 'make' after updating src/limits.h for the changes
	to take effect.
11 Марта 2015: версия vast-1.0rc70 VaST теперь может работать с файлами в именах которых есть пробел. (За исключением случая, когда изображения
	для обработки заданы через файл vast_list_of_input_images_with_time_corrections.txt - в этом случае пробела в имени изображения быть не может).
	Автоматический выбор работающего зеркала VizieR. Программа пробует автоматически угадать поле зрения снимка для решения пластинки
	глядя на уже решенный снимок этого поля или же используя значения ключа FOCALLEN (предполагается в мм) в FITS-шапке изображения.
	Скрипт WCS-калибровки пробует найти решение с большим или меньшем полем зрения, если с первначально выбранным найти решение не удалось.
07 Марта 2015: версия vast-1.0rc69 исправлен баг с парсингом вывода lib/vizquery не позволявший проводить астрометрическую привязку.
	Улучшен алгоритм астрометрической привязки. Просмотрщик FITS-изображений pgfv теперь не забывает ориентацию изображения 
	(выбираемую нажатием V и B на клавиатуре) при изменении масштаба (нажатием Z). При ручной калибровке звёздной величины с помощью
	скрипта util/magnitude_calibration.sh теперь можно отказаться от ввода набрав 99 вместо реальной звёздной величины если Вы случайно
	выбрали не ту калибровочную звезду которую хотели.
	fit_mag_calib теперь пытается угадать какая функция лучше описывает зависимость каталожной звёздной 
	величины от инструментальной: парабола или "фотокривая". Исправлен баг не позволявший работать lib/vizquery без установленного
	в системе cdsclient (не устанавливалась локальная копия wwwget). Для астрометрической калибровки может использоваться один 
	из нескольких резервных серверов (выбираемый автоматически) или программное обеспечение Astrometry.net установленное локально 
	в системе. Добавлена поддержка изображений с необычным заголовком записываемых камерой СБГ Коуровской обсерватории.
	Обновлён файл tai-utc.dat с информацией о leap second. find_candidates aa теперь запоминает ранее просмотренные звёзды.
16 Июня 2014: версия vast-1.0rc68 - восстановлена работа с VizieR после очередного изменения порядка следования колонок в 
	выводе скрипта vizquery. Функция определения минимума по методу Кви-ван Вёрдена (вызываемая кнопкой 'K' в окне
	просмотра кривых блеска) теперь выдаёт полную Юлианскую Дату минимума, а не относительно начала кривой блеска.
	Добавлена возможность задать некоторые или все входные изображения не как аргументы командной строки, а как
	строки в файле vast_list_of_input_images_with_time_corrections.txt Каждому снимку соответсвует одна строка
	с двумя столбцами. Первый столбец - путь к FITS-изображению, второй - поправка к указанному в заголовке FITS-изображения
	времени (указывается в секундах) или полная Юлианская Дата момента получения изображения (указывается в сутках и долях суток), 
	которая будет использована ВМЕСТО той, что получена из FITS-заголовка изображения. В зависимости от значения во втором столбце,
	программа автоматически угадает имеется ли в виду поправка или абсолютное значение Юлианской Даты.
	В командной строке вместо имён файлов можно указывать имя директории. Если указана директория - все FITS-файлы
	в указаной директории будут использованы в обработке. Файлы в поддиректориях указанной директории обработаны не будут.
	Исправлен баг вызывавший ошибку сегментирования при попытке обработать изображения разного размера.
	Небольшие улучшения в алгоритме отождествления ускоряющие его работу на ~10%.
13 Мая 2014: версия vast-1.0rc67 - исправлен баг вызывавший падение с buffer owerflow на длинных сериях изображений.
	Детали астрометрического решения выводятся в терминал (координаты центра, поле зрения, масштаб).
	Улучшен скрипт генерируемый для контроля идентификации в Аладине. Теперь в Аладине отображается исходное изображение
	в дополнение к паломару и отмечается звезда, выбранная в качестве отождествления автоматом.
	Внутренние копии библиотек обновлены до: CFITSIO v3.360, gsl-1.16.
	ПО сервера астрометрических решений обновлено до astrometry.net-0.46.
	Исправлен lib/astrometry/insert_wcs_header чтобы работать с длинными заголовками создаваемыми astrometry.net-0.46.
27 Марта 2014: версия vast-1.0rc66 - добавлен вывод пиксельных координат всех звёзд (в системе пиксельных координат 
	опорного кадра) в лог файлы: vast_list_of_all_stars.log (просто три колонки) и vast_list_of_all_stars.ds9 
	(тоже самое в формате понятном DS9). Исправлен скрипт калибровки звёздной величины за изменившийся формат 
	вывода vizquery. Исправлен баг приводившей к невозможности компиляции свежим gcc если компилятор не может правильно
	определить тип процессора для -march=native. Запуск на машинах с малым количеством памяти.
29 Мая 2013: версия vast-1.0rc65 - добавлена линейная коррекция звёздных величин в зависимости от координат на снимке.
	Разрешено использовать передержанные и блендированные звёзды при нахождении преобразования координат.
	Исправлена проблема с WISE-Atlas в режиме поиска транзиентов.
	Исправлено падение lc при попытке удалить первую точку на не-вастовских кривых блеска.
13 Апреля 2013: версия vast-1.0rc64 - официальная поддержка режима поиска транзиентов
	исправлен баг в сплайн-коррекции координат (незамеченная фишка с gsl-1.15). 
	Ключ JD читается из шапки только если ключ DATE-OBS не был в ней найден. Исправлен скрипт 
	калибровки по Tycho-2 util/transients/calibrate_current_field_with_tycho2.sh
	Исправлен баг не позволявшйи звёздам с очень большой сигмой попасть в финальный список звёзд: data.m_sigma
	убран "&& merr < MAX_MAG_ERROR" в src/data_parser.c, Спасибо FIDRICH Robert за обнаружение проблемы!
	Тестовый скрипт для работы с CSS: util/catalina_search_area_TEST.sh
	Скрипт для автоматического тестирования программы lib/test_vast_release.sh (works only with SExtractor version 2.8.6).
16 Января 2013: версия vast-1.0rc63 - исправлен баг с неотождествлением некоторых звёзд у которых есть близкий сосед.
	Используется внутренняя версия библиотек PGPLOT и GSL. Используется внутренняя версия SExtractor
	если не удалось найти его системную установку в PATH. "./sextract_single_image -9" позволяет использовать
	DS9 для просмотра отдельных изображений. Исправлен баг с несозданием файла vast_stars_with_large_sigma.log
	при использовании gsl-1.15.
	Tested on: MacOS X 10.8.2 'Mountain Lion' + XQuartz, Xcode, MacPorts -> gcc (gfortran, g++), wget
	(resolution is fine with retina display).
	Internal CFITSIO library upgraded to Version 3.31.
28 Октября 2012: версия vast-1.0rc62 - автоматический выбор диапазона периодов при поиске периодов через вэб-интерфейс.
	Просмотренные через вэб-интерфейс кривые блеска сохраняются в папке saved_period_search_lightcurves/.
	Переработан алгоритм отождествления звёзд для ускорения его работы.
28 Мая 2012: версия vast-1.0rc61 - ./lc и lib/formater_out_wfk (запускаемый ./pokaz_winefk.sh) теперь понимают
	кривые блеска с комментариями (строчки с комментариями отбрасываются). Создан скрипт 
	./pokaz_laflerkinman.sh интегрирующий ./lc с веб-сервисом поиска периодов. Для запуска скрипта 
	достаточно в окне ./lc нажать 'L'. Внутренняя копия библиотеки cfitsio обновлена до версии 3.30.
	Исправлен баг не позволявший обрабатывать изображения в шапке которых отсутствует комментарий
	к полю DATE-OBS или аналогичному. Улучшена стабильность калибровки по звёздной величине между кадрами.
	В архив включена локальная копия скрипта vizquery из пакета cdsclient-3.7.
	Включена локальная копия astcheck для экспериментальных скриптов поиска транзиентов.
	VaST теперь корректно обрабатывает ситуацию когда не может породить дочерний процесс во время выполнения
	основной программы (например, такое может произойти из-за недостатка памяти в системе).
	Makefile изменён так что программа может компилироваться на новой Ubuntu.
27 Февраля 2012: версия vast-1.0rc60 - исправлен баг с появляющимися при определённых условиях неверными подписями к осям
	из-за неверной работы функции PGBOX(), см. http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot/problems.html
	Спасибо Денису Денисенко за обнаружение проблемы! Изменён алгоритм записи файлов кривых блеска:
	теперь это происходит параллельно и быстро. Добавлена возможность оффлайн-проверки по VSX.
	Файлы default.sex.ccd_example и default.sex были изменены на более оптимистичный вариант (понижен порог детектирования).
26 Января 2012: версия vast-1.0rc59 - Обновлён tai-utc.dat, теперь он включает прыгающую секунду 1го июля 2012.
	Изменён цвет которым отмечены ранее просмотренные звёзды в find_candidates.
	Исправлен баг с падением программы возникавшем в случае если к моменту окончания обработки последнего кадра
	обработка опорного кадра не успевала завершиться. Оптимизировано общение с сервером при поиске астрометрического
	решения кадра - уменьшен потребляемый трафик. Переписан код работы с кандидатами в транзиенты.
	Множество мелких изменений.
12 Октября 2011: версия vast-1.0rc58 - SExtractor запускается параллельно на несколько файлов чтобы ускорить
	работу на многоядерных и многопроцессорных системах. При запуске внешних программ из графических окон
	родительское окно не замерзает до завершения внешней программы.
20 Сентября 2011: версия vast-1.0rc57 - мелкие улучшения в find_candidates и lib/fit_mag_calib Добавлена
	коррекция астрометрии с использованием сплайнов что должно сильно улучшить точность на оцифрованных
	пластинках. По-умолчанию эта функция выключена! Чтобы включить, отредактируйте util/identify.sh
	Кривая отбора звёзд по сигме теперь по-умолчанию проводится ниже (0.7 сигма вместо 2.0 сигма).
 6 Сентября 2011: версия vast-1.0rc56 - исправлен баг при обращении к VSX. Мелкие изменения в параметрах по-умолчанию.
19 Августа 2011: версия vast-1.0rc55 - добавлена возможность PSF фотометрии (параметр -P). Для работы нужна
	свежая версия SExtractor'а (>2.8.6?) и программа PSFEx. Исправлен баг в скрипте проверки кандидатов по VSX.
 3 Июля 2011: версия vast-1.0rc54 - мелкие изменения. Версия которая просто хорошо работает. :)
 9 Июня 2011: версия vast-1.0rc53 - теперь программа использует встроенную версию cfitsio чтобы обойти постоянные проблемы 
	с её установкой у пользователей + багфиксы. 
15 Мая 2011: версия vast-1.0rc52 - большая переработка алгоритма отождествления. Новый способ выбора опорных треугольников. 
	Добавлена линейная коррекция преобразования координат полученного по лучшему треугольнику. Мелкая чистка кода. 
	Перевод нескольких русскоязычных комментариев на английский.
23 Февраля 2011: версия vast-1.0rc51 - улучшен алгоритм отождествления. Добавлена специальная калибровка 
	для фотографических данных (параметр -o) с использованием формул (1) и (3) из Bacher et al. (2005, MNRAS, 362, 542).
	По техническим причинам версия не тестировалась на Ubuntu до релиза.
11 Декабря 2010: версия vast-1.0rc50 - изменён формат vast_sigma_selection_curve.log. 
	Добавлена интерполяция при отборе звёзд с большой сигма.
	Удалён плохо работающий и редко используемый код связанный с алгоритмом Вэлча-Стетсона.
	Переписан код расчёта гелиоцентрической поправки на базе библиотеки NOVAS. Теперь код работает.
	Добавлен параметр --maxsextractorflag 2 (-x 2) позволяющий включать в обработку звёзды с ненулевым флагом 
	(это полезно, например, если у многих звёзд стоит флаг 2 - бленда, но при этом фотометрия получается 
	с нормальной точностью). Добавлена возможность жёстко задать число опорных звёзд для отождествления кадров
	(параметр -b 100) - полезно если поиск наилучшего решения перебором числа опорных звёзд занимает много времени
	а улучшения отождествления не приносит.
24 Мая 2010: version vast-1.0rc49 - исправлен баг с работой на Ubuntu 9.10, устранены утечки памяти.
	Вроде бы успешная попытка исправить баг с неосвобождением памяти при использовании ключа "-e".
	В ./lc добавлено определение моментов минимума блеска методом KvW.
	./find_candidates теперь рисует линию отброса по сигма, выглядит страшновато...
	Добавлен скрипт проверяющий наличие необходимых внешних программ в системе: lib/check_external_programs.sh
	Множество мелких изменений...
22 January 2010: version vast-1.0rc48 - added automatic identification script util/identify.sh
	Sorry, no russian keyboard. %)
27 Сентября 2009: версия vast-1.0rc46 - мелкие изменения.
 8 Августа 2009: версия vast-1.0rc45 - компиляция подпрограмм использующих pgplot вынесена в
	отдельный шелл-скрипт lib/compile_pgplot_related_components.sh чтобы обойти странный
	баг в Убунте, не позволяющий нормально скомпилировать их из мэйкфайла.
15 Июля 2009: версия vast-1.0rc44 - багфикс релиз - исправление в pokaz_winefk.sh, lc и find_candidates
12 Июля 2009: версия vast-1.0rc43 Как быстро летит время... Изменения в алгоритме отождествления,
	теперь вместо координат звёзд с опорного кадра используются средние координаты в системе 
	опорного кадра рассчитанные по всем кадрам. Вроде бы это улучшило отождествление как 
	отдельных звёзд так и кадров в целом. Кроме того, в случае неудачного отождествления
	программа теперь упорно пытается подобрать число опорных звёзд с которым отождествление пройдёт.
	В lc добавлена возможность убирать скачки и тренды из кривой блеска а также отдельные точки 
	и сохранять результат редактирования. Ещё теперь можно сохранить кривую блеска в PS или PNG файл...
25 Января 2009: версия vast-1.0rc34 Ещё мальца покрутил SysRem. Выпускаю 34го релизкандидата...
23 Января 2009: идёт работа над версией vast-1.0rc34. Добавлен ключ --ds9, для 
	этого переписан draw_stars_with_ds9.sh на основе варианта, присланного 
	Андреем Самохываловым. Добавлена автоматическая генерация autodetect_aper.sex 
	из default.sex.	В папке с программой сохранены несколько характерных примеров 
	default.sex для разных инструментов. Переписан сигма фильтр. Теперь работает со 
	скоростью пули. Всё ещё не ясно как улучшить стабильность и эффективность 
	работы SysRem.
14 Декабря 2008: версия vast-1.0rc33. Добавлен util/sysrem, добавлен отброс 
	вылетающих измерений при привязке кадра к кадру по m параболой. В pgfv теперь
	можно менять яркость и контраст (f+Click). 
29 Ноября 2008: в разработке версия vast-1.0rc33. Перевожу комментарии в коде на англ.
	Пытаюсь добавить SysRem. Недавно добавлена информация в окна с графиками и 
	окна перекрашены в симпатичные цвета.
15 Августа 2008: версия vast-1.0rc28 файл HISTORY не обновлялся какое-то время.
	Изменён режим работы по-умолчанию. Теперь привязка по звёздной величине
	осуществляется параболой, не производится фильтрация кривой блеска,
	максимально допустимое расстояние звезды от расчётного положения 
	выбирается на основе сиинга (в среднем - большее расстояние чем раньше 
	принимается допустимым). Множество багфиксов. Ведётся работа над новыми 
	функциями.
20 Января 2008: версия vast-1.0rc18 багфиксы. В пакет включены тулзы для 
	редукции ПЗС снимков: 
	ms - вычитание темнового кадра
	md - деление на плоское поле
	mk - медианное сложение кадров
15 Декабря 2007: версия vast-1.0rc17 Переход на GPLv3, программы, которые
	не должны в обычных условиях запускаться пользователем перенесены
	в lib/
 9 Марта 2007: Мда... много воды утекло, много строчек кода написано с момента
	последнего обновления этого файла. Старые баги фиксятся, новые - сажаются.
25 Июня 2006: версия vast-1.0rc52 прога несколько переделана и подготовлена...
	Добавлена возможность не проводить привязку по звёздной величине.
 7 Апреля 2006: версия vast-1.0rc5 не буду утверждать что прога стала 
	работать намного быстрее, но открывает/закрывает файлы она реже.
	Все кривые блеска сначала сохраняются в памяти и только потом, когда
	уже обработаны все кадры, кривые записываются в файлы.
11 Марта 2006: версия vast-1.0rc4: к программе приклеена морда на основе 
	библиотеки PGPLOT. Соответственно теперь она нужна для компиляции.
	По сути ничего не изменилось, но работать стало гораздо приятнее. 
	Больше никаких копаний в текстовых файлах, вайнов и внешних смотрелок
	фитсов! 
26 Января 2006: пришлось перекопать find_smallest_sim_dist, а то она как-то 
	глючила с gcc4. Сейчас вроде всё пашет.
25 Января 2006: версия vast-1.0rc3: теперь прога понимает параметры командной
	строки:
	-p привязка по звёздной величине осуществляется старым способом.
	-P вместо default.sex использовать default.sex.PHOTO
	-w считать звёзды одинаковыми, если после преобразования СК их центры
	совпали с точностью 10pix.
	-photo "Фото режим" = ( -w -P -p )
	Если в фитсе обнаружено поле JD то его значение и принимается за момент
	наблюдения. Значения из полей DATE-OBS, TIME-OBS, EXPTIME и т.п. 
	НЕ ИСПОЛЬЗУЮТСЯ! Всё это сделано, чтобы прога хорошо кушала 
	отсканированные фотопластинки.
 8 Ноября  2005: версия vast-1.0rc2: Всё, мы больше не привязаны к GSL!!!
	+ совсем мелкие изменения.
 6 Октября 2005: версия vast-1.0rc1: Изменения в англ. описании. По случаю 
	релиза проект переименовывается в VAST - [VAriable Star Toolkit].
	Респект Сергею Назарову за прикольное название.
28 Сентября 2005: версия poisk09rc4: смол багфиксес в проге и 
	англоязычном описании.
10 Сентября 2005: версия poisk09rc3 сишники скинуты в каталог src. Обнаружена
	позорная бага: поиск переменок по Велшу-Стетсону дохнет на пробных
	данных из-за какой-то поганой пары звёздочек! Бага исправлена.
	В "двухцветные" скрипты добавлено вытирание из "data" строчек со
	значениями индексов nan и inf.
 1 Сентября 2005: версия poisk09rc2 добавлен метод Welch'а-Stetson'а для
	одноцветных наблюдений. Появилась пара мелких вспомогательных 
	программок (combine_obs.c и stat_outfile.c). Добавлено русское 
	описание (вроде) всех 20(!) исполняемых файлов пакета. Написан 
	(вероятно достаточно безграмотно README.en). 
24 Августа 2005: версия poisk09rc2 готовится к релизу. Опять всё переделал. 
	Добавлен автоматический поиск переменных объектов методом 
	Welch'а-Stetson'а. Он рассчитан на двухцветную фотометрию но это 
	наверняка можно ссимулировать.
13 Августа 2005: версия poisk09rc1 Добавил возможность исключать из обработки
	определённые области на кадре. См. README.koi
	Наконец выложу версию poisk09rc1 для публичного доступа.
11 Августа 2005: версия poisk09rc1 Новая фишка: теперь программа для каждого 
	кадра делает два прохода SExtractor'ом, причём из первого определяет
	апертуру с которой меряет звёзды во втором проходе.
	aperture=median(FWHM звёзд)*5
	Удивительно, но сильно хуже не стало! 
	Теперь формат файлов с кривыми блеска:
	 - Юлианская дата (АХТУНГ - не гелиоцентрическая!!!!)
	 - Инструментальная зв. величина в системе опорного кадра
	 - MAGERR выданная секстрактором.
	 - Координаты X Y звезды на данном кадре.
	 - Размер апертуры.
	 - Имя файла из которого получено это измерение.
10 Августа 2005: версия poisk09rc1 Изменил способ привязки по звёздной величине.
	Кажется стало немного лучше... Поэтому сменил большой номер версии. 
	Бедняга "poisk08" так и не дожил до релиза...
	Ещё я тут по ходу дела сдвинул ограничения по кол-ву звёзд на кадре, 
	теперь жить стало веселей.
18 Июня 2005: версия poisk08rc4. Изменён формат файлов с кривыми блеска,
	теперь там нет шапки, поля идут в такой последовательности:
	 - Юлианская дата (АХТУНГ - не гелиоцентрическая!!!!)
	 - Инструментальная зв. величина в системе опорного кадра
	 - MAGERR выданная секстрактором.
	 - Координаты X Y звезды на данном кадре.
	 - Имя файла из которого получено это измерение.
	Кроме того добавлена прога lightcurve_plot для рисования кривых блеска.
	Из за неё мы привязались к библиотеке NCURSES. :(
