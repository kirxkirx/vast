Dear Jessica,

when I upgraded the "Montage" Debian package to the new version 5.0, I
discovered that it uses a slightly modified version of wcstools.
Specifically it contains support for HEALPix and TOAST.

To me, this extension looks quite straightforward, and it would enable
to use HEALPix in the wcstools executable and also in other tools that
link to wcstools, like DS9. For Debian, this patch would be important
since it enables the Debian version of Montage to support Healpix and
Toast -- we are dynamically linking the original version of the wcstools
lib instead of the patched copy in Montage.

Would you consider adding to the next version of wcstools? Or could I
initiate a discussion about what would need to be changed to get it
there? The author of wcstools is John Good (in Cc), and the github web
page is

https://github.com/Caltech-IPAC/Montage

The patch (rebased to the current version 3.9.4 of wcstools) is attached.

Thank you very much
Best regards

Ole

P.S. There is still the issue with the amoeba from Numerical Recipes...

Subject: [PATCH] Support for HEALPix and TOAST

Montage treats HEALPix and TOAST as if they were spherical projections
that can processed with the existing reprojection routines.

These are the changes made by John C Good <jcg@ipac.caltech.edu>
(probably) for the Montage release 5.0. They are rebased here to
wcstools 3.9.4.
